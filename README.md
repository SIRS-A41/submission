# Remote document access with ransomware protection

We present a solution that allows users to create projects, commit versions, revisit older versions, and share them with other users. 

Each project has its own symmetric key which is used to encrypt every file before it is submitted to the server. Project keys are safely stored in the remote server using users' asymmetric key pairs.



<!-- TODO: Give them a summary of the information you will include in your ReadMe using clearly defined sections. -->

## General Information

The ability to send and receive files over the Internet without requiring one of the parties to be connected at the same time greatly simplifies file sharing.

However, this comes with risks. By default, the Internet isn't secure, and without the use of a proper communication channel, this data exchange could be exposed to whoever intercepts the connection. Moreover, if files are stored in a remote server for ease of access at all times, there should be a way to keep their contents secret from unauthorized parties, whether they are users of the system or someone with physical access to the server. This should be done in a way that still allows authorized users to transparently view and edit their files. Even if an attacker canâ€™t read the files, they can launch a ransomware attack and encrypt the files on the server. 

Here we propose a client program, called bag, which behaves similar to *git*. This program handles the interaction with the remote server. This client takes care of criptographic key generation, management, file compression and decompression, encryption and decryption, signing, everything so you only have to interact with it using simple commands.

The server side takes care of handling user authentication, providing an architecture similar to OAuth2.0 with refresh and access tokens. The data kept encrypted on the server, so only the users who should have access to it can read it and modify it. A version history is kept on the remote server, so if the users wants to revisit some files he modified a while ago he can do so.

The remote server also counts with a backup server wich will keep users' data secure in case of ransomware attacks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

There are two options for implementing the developed solution. Self-host all the application in a single machine or divide the application through different machines.

<!-- TODO: In this section also include detailed instructions for installing additiona software the application is dependent upon (such as PostgreSQL database, for example).  -->

You can start by installing [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Then, clone the different repositories:

**auth**:
```
git clone https://github.com/SIRS-A41/auth-api.git ~/Downloads/auth-api
```

**backup**:
```
git clone https://github.com/SIRS-A41/backup.git ~/Downloads/backup
```

**bag**:
```
git clone https://github.com/SIRS-A41/bag.git ~/Downloads/bag
```

**certificates**:
```
git clone https://github.com/SIRS-A41/certificates.git ~/Downloads/certificates
```

**resources**:
```
git clone https://github.com/SIRS-A41/resources-api.git ~/Downloads/resources-api
```

#### Single machine

You will require a computer running Linux. Since our solution uses Docker, it might work on other platforms, but it was not tested.


#### Multiple machines (using VMs)

You'll need an architecture as the one depicted in the Figure below:

<!--  TODO: adicionar figura -->

Since multiple machines are involved, it is required to setup firewalls for each machine.

**firewalls**:
```
git clone https://github.com/SIRS-A41/firewalls.git
```

And also install [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) to work as a reverse proxy:

```
sudo apt install nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
```


### Installing

#### Single machine (easier)

1. Initialize the Redis and Redis commander services:
   
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads/auth-api
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Check everything is working by visiting the Redis Commander instance [localhost:8082](localhost:8082).

3. Initialize the MongoDB and Mongo Express services:
   
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads/resources-api
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Check everything is working by visiting the Mongo Express instance [localhost:8081](localhost:8081).

5. Setup SSH on your machine:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install openssh-server
    sudo systemctl enable sshd
    sudo systemctl start sshd
    ```

6. Create a user called `sirs` with password `123123` for storing the project files:

    ```bash
    sudo useradd -m -e `date -d "7 days" +"%Y-%m-%d"` sirs 
    sudo passwd sirs
    ```
    *Note: the created user account will expire in 7 days.*

7. Discover your machine IP. It is required for generating a valid certificate:
   
   ```bash
   IP=$(ip -o route get to 8.8.8.8 | sed -n 's/.*src \([0-9.]\+\).*/\1/p')
   echo $IP
   ```

8. Generate a valid certificate and import it to Java truststore:

    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads/certificates
    ./generate_certificate.sh <your-local-ip>
    sudo ./import_certificate.sh
    ```

    *Note: the certificate is valid for 30 days.*

9.  Now you must setup the Auth REST API with the correct IP:

    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads/auth-api
    sed -i "s/192\.168\.2\.2/$IP/g" .env
    ```

10. Make a copy of the generated certificates for the Auth REST API to use:

    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads/auth-api
    cp -r ~/Downloads/certificates certificates
    ```

11. You can now build the docker image and run it in a container:

    ```bash
    docker build --no-cache -t auth-api .
    docker run -p 8443:8443 -p 8445:8445 auth-api
    ```

12. You need to change your local IP for the Resources API as well:

    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads/resources-api
    sed -i "s/192\.168\.3\.2/$IP/g" .env
    ```

13. Make a copy of the generated certificates for the Resources REST API to use:

    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads/resources-api
    cp -r ../certificates certificates
    ```

14. You can now build the docker image and run it in a container:

    ```bash
    docker build --no-cache -t resources-api .
    docker run -p 8444:8444 resources-api
    ```

15. Edit the URI in the Java project to use your local machine IP:

    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads/bag 
    sed -i "s/192\.168\.0\.254/$IP/g" src/main/java/com/sirsa41/AuthRequests.java
    sed -i "s/192\.168\.0\.254:8443/$IP:8444/g" src/main/java/com/sirsa41/ResourcesRequests.java
    ```

16. Package to a JAR file:
    ```bash
    mvn assembly:assembly -DdescriptorId=jar-with-dependencies
    ```

17. Setup an alias to execute the compiled JAR:
    ```bash
    alias bag="java -jar ~/Downloads/bag/target/bag-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar"
    ```

18. Run the bag client:
    ```bash
    bag
    ```

*Note: the backup server is not setup when using a single machine, however, you can still do it following the instructions below.*

You're all done!

#### Multiple machines

Make sure you have 7 machines as depicted [above](####multiple-machines-using-vms).

The [`firewalls`](https://github.com/SIRS-A41/firewalls.git) repo contains a script for setting up the Firewall in each machine, *e.g.*, `auth-api.sh`.

    ```

4. Copy key to Resources server:

    ```bash
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub sirs@192.168.4.1
    ```

5. Create a cronjob for backing up the project files on the Resources server `crontab -e`. Add the following line:

    ```
    0 * * * * /home/back/backup/backup.sh
    ```

        listen [::]:8443 ssl default_server;

        location /auth {
            proxy_bind 192.168.1.254;
            proxy_pass https://192.168.1.1:8443;
        }

        location /resources {
            proxy_http_version 1.1;

        access_log /var/log/nginx/default.access.log;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/default.error.log;
    }
    ```

3. Reload nginx:

    ```

8. Check the project versions history:

    ```bash
    bag history
    ```

9. Share the project with `bob`:
